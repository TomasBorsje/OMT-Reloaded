## OpenModularTurrets Reloaded
This is a rewrite of the popular OpenModularTurrets mod for Minecraft+NeoForge 1.21.
This mod adds turrets & turret bases that must be powered. Turrets will consume ammo from turret bases below them, tracking and firing at nearby enemies (or players).
Turrets can also be upgraded with various upgrades, including solar panels, weapon damage, and fire rates.
